    <div class="section_1">
	<div class="col span_1_of_2"><span style="color:red">
	 First part, in this example we have a two column responsive grid. On the left we have a red column, on the right a green one. The problem is that when displayed on devices like iPhones, the red column on the left becomes the first and the green one below. I would like that when they are displayed for desktop they remain, red column on the left and green on the right, but when viewing for mobile I would like the two columns to swap and therefore that the green column is above the red one. Basically I'm asking at  478px the columns swap, with only css.
    </span>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_2">
    <span style="color:green">
	Second part, the solution I found today at work. Without using boostrap or flex properties. With simple css. A duplicate of the row is created, but exchanging the texts. So I will have above a red row on the left and green on the right. Under a green on the left and red on the right.
Now since I want the exchange to be at 478px, I go to the css and through the media queries I say: the 2 row or you must not see from 2400px to 478px. While the first row (the original one) must not be seen from 0px to 478px. The game is done.
